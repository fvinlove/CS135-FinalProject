# CS135-FinalProject
Final group project for CS 135

This was the final group project for CS 135 at the University of Nevada, Reno in Fall 2014. The group included Kurt Andersen, Ryan Battistone, and myself (Frances Vinlove). It is based on the game Battleship, only goofier. Written in Javascript, it is easily played by opening the source code in a browser window. Make sure to download all the files and keep them in the same directory so the images and sounds function properly. Also, make sure your browser doesn't have any ad-blocking software enabled or else the music won't play. Enjoy!
